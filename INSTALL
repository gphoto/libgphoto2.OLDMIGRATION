########################################################################

The installation procedure should be quite simple:

0) If you got your source tree from CVS (and not from a .tar.gz
   tarball), you have to run ./autogen.sh instead of ./configure in 
   step 1).  In this case, you will need to have the following software
   installed:

	autoconf

	automake (ver. >= 1.5)

	libtool (ver. >= 1.4)

1) ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
	or any other options (try --help)

   See the end of this file for some hints on configuring for certain
   platforms.

   The following software components are optional, and will improve the
   libraries' and/or command-line client's functionality if present:

	libusb (ver. >= 0.1.5) -- Universal Serial Bus camera support
	    <URL:http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/libusb/>

	gettext (ver. >= 0.10.35) -- internationalization using shared library

	aalib -- picture preview
	    <URL:http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/aa-project/>

	cdk -- camera configuration dialogs
	    <URL:http://dickey.his.com/cdk/>

	gtk-doc -- documentation built in doc/api/

	jpeglib -- JPEG picture preview

	libexif - EXIF tag support
	    <URL:http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/libexif>

   Please check the output of the configure script for whether all
   desired libraries have been detected correctly. E.g., you might
   have to add the path where libusb-config resides to your PATH
   before running configure.

2) make install

   This installs the software and documentation into the proper
   directories on your system. If you want to use your system's
   package system instead, follow a) or b) instead.

   a) make rpm

      (This is not working properly, as of 2001-11-19. We're working 
       on a fix)

      If you're running a RPM based system (e.g. Redhat Linux or SuSE
      Linux), you can build RPM packages and install these. The
      packages will be located in packaging/rpm/RPMS/.

   b) make deb

      (This is not implemented yet)

      If you're running a DEB based system (e.g. Debian GNU/Linux),
      you can build .deb packages and install these. The packages will
      be located in FIXME. 

3) ready to rock

Note that gphoto2 is not designed to be installed as a setuid/setgid
program. Running ANY gphoto2 frontend as root or setuid root or in a
similar fashion will open up a SECURITY HOLE in your system!

Read doc/FAQ if you run into problems.
Read doc/gphoto2.txt for more general information about how to
configure gphoto2.

If you have permission problems when accessing your camera, read
doc/gphoto2.txt -- you will probably want to create a new user group
for the users that are to have camera access and change the
permissions of the serial or USB device to match.


Compiling Hints:

gphoto2 has been successfully used on many system.  Some systems where it
has been reported to successfully compile are listed below. Not all, or even
any, camera libraries have been tested on these systems, so there may be
endian other other issues that prevent some camera libraries from working.
Please report any changes to this list to the gphoto2 developer mailing
list.  As of this writing, USB support is only available on Linux and
FreeBSD as those are the only systems on which libusb is available.

If you have build problems in the intl or po directories, try re-running
configure with the --disable-nls flag.  If configure stops due to an error
with 'test', try re-running configure with the --without-usb flag.  If
'make' reports an error, try using GNU make (often called gmake or gnumake)
instead of the make that comes with your system.  If one camera driver
has compilation errors, re-run configure with an appropriate --with-drivers=
flag to prevent that driver from being compiled.

i386:
  Debian GNU/Linux 2.2
  Red Hat Linux 7.1
  Red Hat Linux 4.2
  TurboLinux 6.5
  Slackware Linux 8.0
  FreeBSD 4.3
	Try the following to configure the optional libraries:
	  env CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" \
	  LDFLAGS="-I/usr/local/lib" ./configure
	(you may also need to append the flag --disable-nls).
	Use GNU make to build (gmake).

Alpha:
  Debian GNU/Linux 2.2
  OpenBSD 3.0
  NetBSD 1.5.1
  	Configure with this command:
  	  ./configure --disable-nls
	Use GNU make to build (gmake).
  Tru64 5.1A
  	Configure with this command:
  	  env CFLAGS='-D__STDC_VERSION__=0' ./configure --disable-nls
	Use GNU make to build (gnumake).

PowerPC:
  Debian GNU/Linux 2.2
  Apple Darwin/OS X
  	Need dlcompat from <URL:http://fink.sourceforge.net>
  	Configure with this command:
  	  env CFLAGS="-I/path/to/dlcompat -no-cpp-precomp" \
  	  LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/dlcompat" ./configure --disable-nls
	Need libtool ver. >= 1.4.2a

Sparc:
  Debian GNU/Linux 2.2
  Solaris 8 (gcc)
  	Configure with this command:
  		./configure --without-usb
	and use GNU make to build (gmake).

StrongARM:
  Intimate+Debian iPAQ GNU/Linux (native gcc)
  Linux (cross-compiled gcc)

Itanium:
  Red Hat 7.1 (gcc)


The following systems have some problems compiling, but may be made to
work with some effort:

Itanium:
  Red Hat 7.1 (Intel ecc)
  	There is a bug in ver. 5.0.1 of this compiler tickled by gphoto2 that
  	prevents full compilation.
  	Need better libtool support (newer than version 1.4.2).
  Red Hat 7.1 (sgicc)
  	Need better libtool support (newer than version 1.4.2).

Sparc:
  Solaris 8 (cc)
  	Sun's cc doesn't support #warning or # or ## macro features, which
  	occur several times in the code.


Thanks go to SourceForge for their compile farm, and Compaq for their
TestDrive program which allowed gphoto2 to be tested on many of these
systems.
