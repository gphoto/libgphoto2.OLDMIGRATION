The installation procedure should be quite simple:

1) ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
	or any other options (try --help)

   If you have difficulties building on FreeBSD, try --disable-nls.

2) make install

   This installs the software and documentation into the proper
   directories on your system. If you want to use your system's
   package system instead, follow a) or b) instead.

   a) make rpm

      If you're running a RPM based system (e.g. Redhat Linux or SuSE
      Linux), you can build RPM packages and install these. The
      packages will be located in packaging/rpm/RPMS/.

   b) make deb

      (This is not implemented yet)

      If you're running a DEB based system (e.g. Debian GNU/Linux),
      you can build .deb packages and install these. The packages will
      be located in FIXME.
