The installation procedure should be quite simple:

0) If you got your source tree from CVS (and not from a .tar.gz
   tarball), you have to run ./autogen.sh instead of ./configure in 
   step 1).  In this case, you will need to have the following software
   installed:
	autoconf
	automake
	libtool (ver. >= 1.4)

1) ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
	or any other options (try --help)

   If you have difficulties building on FreeBSD, try --disable-nls.

   In order to get USB support, you must have libusb installed on
   your system (http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb). As of
   2002-01-01, a current CVS version of libusb (or the upcoming 0.1.5
   release) is required.

   The following software components are optional, and will improve the
   libraries' and/or command-line client's functionality if present:
    libusb -- Universal Serial Bus camera support
	gettext (ver. >= 0.10.35) -- internationalization using shared library
	cdk (ver. >= 4.9.10) -- camera configuration dialogs
	aalib -- picture preview
	jpeglib -- JPEG picture preview

2) make install

   This installs the software and documentation into the proper
   directories on your system. If you want to use your system's
   package system instead, follow a) or b) instead.

   a) make rpm

      (This is not working properly, as of 2001-11-19. We're working 
       on a fix)

      If you're running a RPM based system (e.g. Redhat Linux or SuSE
      Linux), you can build RPM packages and install these. The
      packages will be located in packaging/rpm/RPMS/.

   b) make deb

      (This is not implemented yet)

      If you're running a DEB based system (e.g. Debian GNU/Linux),
      you can build .deb packages and install these. The packages will
      be located in FIXME.
