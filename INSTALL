# This file describes how to install gphoto2.
########################################################################

The installation procedure should be quite simple:

0) If you got your source tree from CVS (and not from a .tar.gz
   tarball), you have to run ./autogen.sh instead of ./configure in 
   step 1).  In this case, you will need to have the following software
   installed:
	autoconf
	automake (ver. >= 1.5)
	libtool (ver. >= 1.4)

1) ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
	or any other options (try --help)

   If you have difficulties building on FreeBSD, try --disable-nls.

   In order to get USB support, you must have libusb installed on
   your system (http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb). As of
   2002-01-01, a current CVS version of libusb (or the upcoming 0.1.5
   release) is required.

   The following software components are optional, and will improve the
   libraries' and/or command-line client's functionality if present:
	libusb (ver. >= 0.1.5) -- Universal Serial Bus camera support
	gettext (ver. >= 0.10.35) -- internationalization using shared library
	cdk (ver. >= 4.9.10) -- camera configuration dialogs
	aalib -- picture preview
	jpeglib -- JPEG picture preview
	gtk-doc -- documentation built in doc/api/

2) make install

   This installs the software and documentation into the proper
   directories on your system. If you want to use your system's
   package system instead, follow a) or b) instead.

   a) make rpm

      (This is not working properly, as of 2001-11-19. We're working 
       on a fix)

      If you're running a RPM based system (e.g. Redhat Linux or SuSE
      Linux), you can build RPM packages and install these. The
      packages will be located in packaging/rpm/RPMS/.

   b) make deb

      (This is not implemented yet)

      If you're running a DEB based system (e.g. Debian GNU/Linux),
      you can build .deb packages and install these. The packages will
      be located in FIXME. 

gphoto2 has been successfully used on many system.  Some systems where it
has been reported to successfully compile are listed below. Not all, or even
any, camera libraries have been tested on these systems, so there may be
endian other other issues that prevent some camera libraries from working.
Please report any changes to this list to the gphoto2 developer mailing
list.  As of this writing, USB support is only available on Linux and
FreeBSD as those are the only systems on which libusb is available.

i386:
  Debian GNU/Linux 2.2
  Red Hat Linux 7.1
  Red Hat Linux 4.2
  TurboLinux 6.5
  Slackware Linux 8.0
  FreeBSD 4.3
	Try the following to configure the optional libraries:
	  env CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" \
	  LDFLAGS="-I/usr/local/lib" ./configure --disable-included-nls

Alpha:
  OpenBSD 3.0
  NetBSD 1.5.1

PowerPC:
  Debian GNU/Linux 2.2

Sparc:
  Debian GNU/Linux 2.2
  Solaris 8 (gcc)
  	Configure with this command:
  		./configure --without-usb
	and use GNU make to build (gmake).

StrongARM:
  Intimate/Debian iPAQ GNU/Linux (native gcc)
  Linux (cross-compiled gcc)


The following systems have some problems compiling, but could be made to work
with some effort.  Many linking problems should be resolved with an
newer libtool (newer than version 1.4.2):

PowerPC:
  Apple Darwin (OS X)
  	Need dlcompat from <URL:http://fink.sourceforge.net>
  	Configure with this command:
  	  env CFLAGS="-I/path/to/dlcompat -no-cpp-precomp" \
  	  LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/dlcompat" ./configure --disable-nls

Itanium:
  Red Hat 7.1 (gcc)
  	Need better libtool support.
  Red Hat 7.1 (Intel ecc)
  	There are two bugs in this compiler tickled by gphoto2 that prevent
  	full compilation, but are fairly simple to overcome.
  Red Hat 7.1 (sgicc)
  	Need better libtool support.

Alpha:
  Debian GNU/Linux 2.2
  	Need better libtool support.
  Tru64 5.1A
  	Configure with this command:
  	  CFLAGS='-D__STDC_VERSION__=0' ./configure --disable-nls
  	Some build problems related to make (might work with GNU make).

Sparc:
  Solaris 8 (cc)
  	Sun's cc doesn't support #warning or # or ## macro features, which
  	occur several times in the code.


Thanks go to SourceForge for their compile farm, and Compaq for their
TestDrive program which allowed gphoto2 to be tested on many of these
systems.
