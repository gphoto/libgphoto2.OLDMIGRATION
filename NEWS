libgphoto2 2.3.1

PTP:
   * Fixed a memory leak in continuous Nikon / Canon capture mode.

Bindings:
   * Moved all bindings into separate packages.

Package / System integration:
   * Add README.packaging file.
   * Removed obsolete print-usb-usermap. Use
     "print-camera-list usb-usermap usbcam" instead.
   * Fix libgphoto2 symbol list: Removed gpi_gphoto_port_type_map
   * Add new permission setup script doing class based matching for
     PTP class cameras not listed explicitly by USB IDs.
     This script (check-ptp-camera) is used by the generated UDEV rules.

     Example usage:
	 print-camera-list udev-rules mode 660 group plugdev \
              > /etc/udev/rules.d/90-libgphoto2.rules

     or similar and set udevscriptdir='/lib/udev' at configure time or adjust
     the path to check-ptp-camera in the generated /etc/udev/rules.d/90-libgpoto2.rules
     file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

libgphoto2 2.2.1

   * Fix build for FreeBSD users (and other non-Linux)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

libgphoto2 2.2.0


Build system (packagers beware!):

   * You should generate HAL FDI, linux-hotplug usb.usermap, and udev rules
     now via our program:

 	  ${libdir}/print-camera-list (hal-fdi|usb-usermap|udev-rules)

     During a chrooted build you can use:
	CAMLIBS=$BUILDROOT/usr/lib/libgphoto2/2.2/ print-camera-list hal-fdi

     This obsoletes print-usb-usermap and print-udev-rules.

     The hal FDI file should be put into:
	/usr/share/hal/fdi/information/10freedesktop/10-camera-libgphoto2.fdi

     If you need to generate different stuff based on the cameras, please add
     it to the "print-camera-list" helper.

   * Added C# (csharp) bindings

     Thanks to Patrick van Staveren <trick@vanstaveren.us>'s initiative,
     we now compile, ship and install the C# bindings. However, a few
     things will still change about it, so don't just completely rely on
     it, its file names and locations, etc. just yet.


Client programmers (KDE, GNOME, MONO, C....) with specific character
set requirements:

   * We added new function gp_message_codeset(const char*) to API.
      - If you do not call this function, libgphoto2 will give you its
        messages in the codeset defined by the system locale.
	(The system locale is defined by the LANG, LANGUAGE, and LC_*
	environment variables.)
      - Call this function with your desired codeset if you require
        libgphoto2 messages in a fixed codeset independent from the
        system locale. For example, GTK+ applications always expect UTF-8.
      - gp_message_codeset() propagates the requested charset to
        libgphoto2_port and then calls gettext's bind_textdomain_codeset()
        function.
    * Added gp_camera_wait_for_event() API, to wait for
      specific camera events and return them to the caller.


libgphoto2 changes:

   * libgphoto DSO version is now 2.1.0

   * Lots of bugs were fixed.

   * New translations were added.

Driver changes:

   * PTP

     - PTP/IP support has been added.

     - On selected Nikon and Canon cameras it is now possible to capture
       images into the Camera SDRAM and in turn downloading it to libgphoto2
       internal storage, bypassing the memory card.

       To enable it, use the "capturetarget" setting, also saved in
       .gphoto/settings.

       This is useful for:
	   gphoto2 --capture-image -f /store_00010001 -p capt0000.jpg

       Or use the timelapse capture of gphoto2:
	   gphoto2 --capture-image -F <total frames> -I <seconds interval>

       Or write your own client using libgphoto2...


     - Support of MTP devices has been greatly enhanced.

       + Creative Zen devices now work.
       + iRiver devices work, but have some protocol subtleties / flaws.

       + Object Property (Meta Data) support now works in a basic way.

	   GP_FILE_TYPE_METADATA type get and put can be used to retrieve
	   and set meta data for files.

	   get: Returns all available properties and their contents.

	   put: Set the properties found in the file to the specified content.
		The non-listed are untouched.

	   The metadata looks like:
		   <Artist>Elvis Presley</Artist>

	   gphoto2 -f /store_00010001/Folder... --get-metadata file.mp3 --stdout > meta_file.mp3
	   ... edit meta_file.mp3 ...
	   gphoto2 -f /store_00010001/Folder... --upload-metadata meta_file.mp3

	   gphoto2 --get-all-metadata	... retrieves metadata of all files, with meta_ prefix.

       - Better --summary output, listing also Storage Devices and Device abilities.

       - Lots of new device ids.
         * Canon 5D, 30D, A340, A700, S40, S80
	 * Nikon D200
         * Casio EX-Z120
         * Kodak C360, Z700
         * HP M317
	 * Panasonic DMC-LC1
         * Fuji E900
         

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
libgphoto2 2.1.99 (pre-release of 2.2)

Build system (packagers beware!):

   * now requires libltdl (from system or shipped with tarball)
   * works with contemporary build tools
   * new ./configure parameter set
   * no more accidentally building without libusb (use --without-libusb
     if you insist on that)
   * camlibs and iolibs are now installed into new directories
   * libhal 0.5 is currently an option for the disk: port.
     Distribution that ships it might want to build it with it.

libgphoto2:

   * If set, use environment variable CAMLIBS to find the camera drivers.
     Ditto for libgphoto2_port, IOLIBS and IO drivers.
   * disk: "port" for USB Mass Storage support
   * various USB fixes
   * Generate .fdi files for HAL
   * Memory usage greatly reduced by only keeping last 2 pictures
     in memory cache

Drivers (camlibs)

   * basic MTP support for iRiver mp3 players using ptp driver T10,
     T20, T30, M415

   * canon
     * IXY Digital 600 fixes
     * Added A610
     * Experimental SD500
     * Experimental A620 (not really working)

   * casio
     * various fixes in QV-10 driver

   * digigr8 (NEW)
     * support Digigr8, Che-Ez Snap SNAP-U, Soundstar TDC-35

   * kodak/dc210
     * Added DC215

   * ricoh/g3
     * Ricoh Caplio GX, GX 8
     * Ricoh R2, R3
     * Rollei dr5 

   * hp215 (NEW)
     * support HP 215

   * lg_gsm (NEW)
     * support LG T5100

   * mars
     * various fixes
     * Added Argus DC-1620, DC-1610 (experimental)
     * Added Philips P44417B

   * pdc640
     * Added Clever CAM 360

   * ptp
     * For Nikon, handle ISO speed, aperture, exposure program,
       capture, focus metering mode, flash mode, AF beep toggle
     * Nikon curve
     * Added Kodak Z730, Z7590, C340, LS753, V530, V550, C310, C330
     * Added Nikon D50, D70s, 4600, 4800, 5600, 5900, Coolpix P2
     * Added Canon A410, A520, A610, A620, IXUS 55, SD450, IXUS 750
     * Added HP R817, Photosmart M23
     * Added Olympus D-540z, C-310z, X-100
     * Added Panasonic Lumix FZ5, DMC-LZ2
     * Added Ricoh R3
     * Added Sony DSC-H1, DSC-R1
     * Added MTP devices (mp3 players)
     * Some iRiver MTP devices (mp3/ogg players) are supported too,
       but are experimental.

       While the "Creative Zen Micro" is also an MTP device, we were
       not able yet to decipher the PTP protocol deviation.

       In general, MTP devices can be supported here, but you need
       to add the ID in camlibs/ptp2/library.c directly, since they
       do not have a USB class id.

     * Now supports a "fast filesystem" mode on newer Nikon PTP cameras.
     
       This speeds up initialisation notably on cameras with lots (>50)
       of images.

       However, this mode does not find the special files on the camera
       (AUTPRNT.MRK). It also cannot represent the correct directory
       structure.

       For normal users (who just download and process the images) the
       "fast" mode is recommended.

       It can be toggled in the "Camera Settings" menu and ~/.gphoto/settings.
