On 2002-12-01, after almost five months, we have finally released a new
version of libgphoto2.

Version 2.1.1 now features support for almost 300 digital cameras.

The most important changes since the the 2.1.0 release are (see
CHANGES for a complete list):

	- new support for quite a lot of new cameras
	- improved/fixed support for a lot "old" cameras
	- libgphoto2 and the gphoto2 command line utility are now
          separated
	- also moved documentation to a separate module

Have fun with your photos!
