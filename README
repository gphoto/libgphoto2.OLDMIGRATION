			       -------

Hello and welcome to the wonderful world of gphoto! This is gphoto2, the 
successor of gphoto with lots of new features and additional camera
drivers. 

If you miss a feature, would like to report success or failure, or have any
questions, please don't hesitate to contact our mailing list.



What is gphoto2?
----------------

gphoto2 is a library that can be used by applications to access various 
digital cameras.  

Additionally, the command-line frontend, which is shipped with the library,
is called gphoto2, too.

For more information on gphoto, see

        http://www.gphoto.org

There, you can also get information on mailing lists, supported cameras,
and availability of gphoto2. Another source of information is

        http://www.sourceforge.org/projects/gphoto

where you can access our CVS server to fetch the source code of
gphoto2, gtkam and GnoCam (see below).

Requirements
------------

The konica driver depends on glib. If you do not need this driver, use the
"--with-drivers=xxx" flag to avoid the glib dependency.

Platforms
---------

gphoto2 should compile and run on pretty much all Unix-like platforms.
Additionally, there is a port for OS/2 available. gphoto2 has _not_ (yet?) 
been ported to any operating system from MicroSoft.

Frontends
---------

gphoto2 ships with a command line frontend which is quite powerful, 
especially in combination with scripts. For the GUI lovers, there are for
example gtkam (GTK based), and GnoCam (GNOME). Additionally, there
are plugins for other programs available like kio_gphoto (KDE - Konqueror).
