			       -------

Hello and welcome to the wonderful world of gphoto! This is gphoto2, the 
successor of gphoto with lots of new features and additional camera
drivers. 

If you miss a feature, would like to report success or failure, or have any
questions, please don't hesitate to contact our mailing list.



What is gphoto2?
----------------

gphoto2 is a library that can be used by applications to access various 
digital cameras.  

Additionally, the command-line frontend, which is shipped with the library,
is called gphoto2, too.

For more information on gphoto, see

        http://www.gphoto.org

There, you can also get information on mailing lists, supported cameras,
and availability of gphoto2. Another source of information is

        http://www.sourceforge.org/projects/gphoto

where you can access our CVS server to fetch the source code of
gphoto2, gtkam and GnoCam (see below).

What is gphoto2 not?
--------------------

gphoto2 can only talk to cameras the language of those it understands. That is,
if you own a camera that speaks a language that isn't published anywhere and 
nobody has been able to figure out the meaning of the sentences, gphoto2 cannot
communicate with those cameras. 

Then, there are cameras supporting the so-called USB Mass Storage protocol.
This is a protocol that has been published and lets you access any storage
device, be it a camera or a disk connected via USB to your computer. As there
are already drivers for this protocol out there, you don't need an additional
program like gphoto2. As of now, the following cameras seem to support the 
USB Mass Storage protocol:
 * Casio QV [2x00,3x00,8000]
 * FinePix [1400,2400,4700]Zoom, 1300, 4500
 * HP PhotoSmart 315, 618, 912
 * Leica Digilux 4.3
 * Minolta Dimage 7
 * Nikon Coolpix 995
 * Olympus C-200Z, C-860L, C-2040, C-3040Z
 * Sony DSC-F505(V), DSC-F707, DSC P5
Again, those cameras cannot be accessed through gphoto2.

Requirements
------------

The konica driver depends on glib. If you do not need this driver, use the
"--with-drivers=xxx" flag to avoid the glib dependency.

Platforms
---------

gphoto2 should compile and run on pretty much all Unix-like platforms.
Additionally, there is a port for OS/2 available. gphoto2 has _not_ (yet?) 
been ported to any operating system from MicroSoft.

Frontends
---------

gphoto2 ships with a command line frontend which is quite powerful, 
especially in combination with scripts. For the GUI lovers, there are for
example gtkam (GTK based), and GnoCam (GNOME). Additionally, there
are plugins for other programs available like kio_gphoto (KDE - Konqueror).
