This list of testers is intended for driver developers to 
find people with the required types of cameras to test their drivers.
Therefore it is sorted by the camera type.

If you create some changes to a special driver have to test the driver 
on a type of camera you have no access to, you may contact these nice 
folks.

If you have a camera not yet on this list and want to help develop the 
gphoto project, we ask you to join the testers. Just tell us at 
<gphoto-devel@gphoto.org> to include you on this list.

This will mean your name and e-mail will be distributed with every
source copy of gphoto2 and be published at http://gphoto.org/. 

It will also mean that you will test software that is UNTESTED AND
POSSIBLY DANGEROUS TO YOUR HARDWARE OR YOUR HEALTH. You will do this
on YOUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY. 

But it will also mean that you will be able to help develop the driver
and possibly be the first one to test the long-awaited working driver
:-)

This said, we developers also continually test our software risking
thousands of dollars' worth of hardware and our lives. :-)
