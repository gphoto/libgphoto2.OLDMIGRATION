- Fix the camera settings problem: Leave the gp_frontend_prompt for smaller
  configuration problems (i.e. right before taking a picture), but add
   * typedef int (*CameraApply) (Camera*, CameraWidget*)
   * gp_camera_settings_get (Camera *camera, CameraWidget *window, 
   				CameraApply apply)
   * gp_camera_settings_set (Camera *camera, CameraWidget *window)

- Make 'make distcheck' to work.

- Define the way capturing images/videos/previews work. IMHO, it should be
   * image/video: Capture image/video, store it on memory card. That's it.
   * preview: Capture preview, don't store it anywhere but return it 
     immediately.

- New function: gp_camera_file_get_info. The info should contain
   * size (file_size)
   * size of preview (preview_size)
   * permissions (GP_PERM_READ | GP_PERM_WRITE | GP_PERM_EXEC)
   * mime type (mime_type)
   * ref count (ref_count)
  Supporting functions: 
   * gp_file_info_ref
   * gp_file_info_unref
