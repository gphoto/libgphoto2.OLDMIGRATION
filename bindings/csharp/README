This code has been imported from f-spot and adapted slightly to fit into
the libgphoto2 build system.

http://ftp.gnome.org/Public/GNOME/sources/f-spot/0.1/f-spot-0.1.1.tar.bz2

IMPORTANT NOTE:

   This is in pre-alpha state, we still have a few things to figure
   out before we can call this interface stable.


TODO:

 * gmcs vs. mcs
   Libraries compiled with gmcs (C# 2.0) and mcs (C# 1.x) are not compatible.
   Does one ship both? What should they be named, and where should they be
   installed? And how is an application supposed to detect their respective
   presence?
   
 * Is there a cleaner set of automake/autoconf macros for C#/mono?

 * Define special binding macros like the camlib or iolib macros, perhaps
   even define a generic set of macros for all three.
