 * This swig-java build process needs to be integrated into the
   libtool process used by the rest of the library
 * Bindings for other languages supported by SWIG
 * May need more helper functions in the SWIG interface file for
   dereferencing pointers and converting types.
 * Clean up build system
 * Make bindings and test cases work with non-Sun java
