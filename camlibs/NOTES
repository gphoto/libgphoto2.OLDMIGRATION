* Interfaces should wait to close the configuration dialog until gp_config_set returns.
  If GP_OK is returned, close the window.
  If GP_ERROR is returned, it is expected that the camera libraries have already notified
  the user of an error by using gp_message(). Leave the window open so they can make the necessary
  changes.
