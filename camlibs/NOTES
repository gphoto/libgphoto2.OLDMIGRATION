* Interfaces should wait to close the configuration dialog until gp_config_set returns.
  If GP_OK is returned, close the window.
  If GP_ERROR is returned, it is expected that the camera libraries have already notified
  the user of an error by using gp_message(). Leave the window open so they can make the necessary
  changes.

* To add a camera library to gPhoto2:

	1) create a directory in camlibs/ for your driver.
	2) copy over the contents of the template/ directory.
	3) rename files to your liking.
	4) edit the Makefile.am file in your directory to change filenames and
	   such.
	5) write your code (step #5 takes the longest ;)
	6) contact the gphoto-devel list to have the library added to the build 
	   process.
