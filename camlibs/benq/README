What is it?
-----------
This is a camlib supporting the Benq DC1300 camera and possibly others. It was
implemented using information obtained by sniffing the usb bus on Windows,
disassembling the windows driver dll's and some guesswork. 

Features
--------
It currently supports downloading of images and deleting all files on the
camera.

Johan Nilsson <jni@users.sourceforge.net> made windows snoops, tested the
early versions and helped debug them. Without him, this would not have been
possible.
