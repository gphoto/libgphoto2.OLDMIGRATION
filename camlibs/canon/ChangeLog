2004-01-31  Marcus Meissner <marcus@jet.franken.de>

	* canon.c, canon.h: Richard Simpson <richard@huskydog.org.uk>
	  Support for Canon MV650i.

2004-01-14  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* canon.c, canon.h: Add support for Canon ZR-70MC
	  Thanks for the report by Kevin R. Bulgrien.

2004-01-02  Marcus Meissner <marcus@jet.franken.de>

	* canon.c, usb.c: lock keys and audio support in PowerShot S50, from
	  rcaputo@users.sf.net

2003-11-08  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* canon.c, canon.h: Added support for Optura 20 (reported by Walt H)

2003-10-27  Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.de>

	* canon.c: PowerShot S50 and A300 got lost somewhere.

2003-09-20  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* canon.c, canon.h, usb.c, usb.h: Added G5 support
	  (patches by Andreas Klemm <andreas@FreeBSD.org>)

2003-10-10 Olivier Crete <tester@tester.ca>
	* library.c: Add Canon A80

2003-09-20  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* canon.c, canon.h, usb.c: Added support for 
          EOS 300D/Digital Rebel/KISS Digital, thanks to Johan Herland 
          and T.V.

2003-05-19 Marcus Meissner <marcus@jet.franken.de>
	
	* canon.c, canon.h: Added 4 patches with support
	  for the A300, S400, A60 and A70. (Might not be 100%
	  correct in specifying subtypes and capture ability.)

	  These seem to parallel support PTP and Canon mode
	  with 1 USB id according to traces sent. Strange.

2003-05-06 Marcus Meissner <marcus@jet.franken.de>
	
	* library.c,canon.c: 2 bug fixes for audio files from
	  Ben Low <ben@bdlow.net>.

2003-04-07 Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* Update README, TODO, ChangeLog
	* Support for Optura 200 MC/MVX2i camcorder

2003-04-04 Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* CANON_PS_A70 is now CANON_PS_PRO70, to avoid confusion with new
	  PowerShot A70, a completely different camera.
	* Added comments with product ID's for A60, A70, which are PTP-only.
	* Added ID's for EOS 10D; will use same code as EOS D30/D60.
	* Image key and size (for immediate download from capture) are now
	  in the CameraPrivateLibrary structure, so they aren't passed as
	  explicit parameters.
	* capture_step moved to CameraPrivateLibrary structure to keep track
	  of interrupt reads during image capture; this was formerly a local
	  variable in canon_usb_capture_dialogue().
	* Fixed comment since we now supply a real serial number with each
	  command packet.
	* New function canon_usb_set_file_time() to be used after file upload.
	* New function canon_usb_set_file_attributes().
	* New functions canon_usb_get_captured_thumbnail(),
	  canon_usb_get_captured_image(), canon_int_capture_preview(),
	  is_audio(), canon_int_filename2audioname().
	* Transfer mode bits are now in enum canonTransferMode.
	* New enum canonDownloadImageType.
	* Converted #define's in usb.h to enums
	* Moved prototypes to end of usb.h, since they now use the enums.
	* Max read size USB_BULK_READ_SIZE is now 0x1400 to match
	  Canon software; was 0x3000.
	* Moved transfer mode bits to from usb.h to canon.h.
	* Messed with file upload; now sets file time from host file time.
	  Still doesn't work any better.

2003-02-28 Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* Removed "capturing" field from CameraPrivateLibrary; it was unused.
	* EOS capture is no longer flagged as "experimental".
	* Implemented canon_capture_preview(); it was a no-op.

2003-02-27  Marcus Meissner <marcus@jet.franken.de>
	
	* library.c: We support EXIF download.

2003-02-27 Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* Changed all C++-style comments ("//") to C-style "/* ... */".
          Gcc allows C++ form in C programs, but it's not quite ANSI.
	* In canon_int_capture_image(), deduce path and file name of
	  captured image and return as specified in the API
	* Added function canon_usb_list_all_dirs() to support path and
	  file name deduction in canon_int_capture_image().

2003-02-18 Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* canon_usb_capture_dialogue() now gets error context
	* Added extra NUL to end of "delete file" command; this
	  eliminates an error code 0200000086.
	* canon_usb_unlock_keys() now gets error context and reports
	  errors (non-zero status code in 0x50 of reply).
	* Better error checking in canon_usb_lock_keys(); now we
	  *do* know what those bytes mean (they are a 32-bit status
	  code).
	* Change locking code so that older "default" cameras are
	  now explicit; the new default is like S45 and G3, on the
	  assumption that new cameras will probably behave like this.
	* canon_usb_capture_dialogue() now gets error context to
	  pass to canon_usb_capture_dialogue().

2003-02-14 Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* Corrected comment explaining path returned from capture.
	* Added labels for all values of canonCamModel, for gtk-doc.
	* Added PowerShot G3 to special-case locking: use non-EOS locking,
          but no "get photo abilities" command.

2003-02-11 Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* Tidy comments (esp. for gtk-doc)
	* Return "*UNKNOWN*" for both path and file names from capture, since
	  I don't know how to get the information after capture. Previously,
	  random garbage was returned.
	* Flag GP_DEBUG messages with name of originating function.
	* Clean up better on capture error (exit control mode).
	* Convert many constant #define's to enum's.
	* Moved many constant #define's from library.h to canon.h.
	* Moved macro IS_EOS() to canon.h.
	* Supply unique serial number in each command.
	* Alter "already awake" initialization for EOS cameras.
	  This still doesn't work :(.
	* Alter key locking. EOS cameras are locked just before
	  "release shutter" command and unlocked as soon as possible
	  afterward. PowerShot cameras are unlocked at initialization
	  and can't be unlocked from software. The user must unplug the
	  USB cable to unlock the keys on these cameras.
	* Unify polling of interrupt pipe in canon_usb_poll_interrupt_pipe().
	* Read interrupt pipe to clear it, both before "release shutter"
	  command and after an error (interrupt messages out of sequence)
	  in capture.
	* Increase timeout for "release shutter" command. EOS cameras
	  sometimes take a long time (>10sec) to complete this command.
	  Is this because of a buffer flush?
	* Improve handling of interrupt messages in "release shutter".
	* Check status at 0x50 in response, where appropriate, and report
	  a non-zero status code via GP_DEBUG (in canon_usb_dialogue).
	* Increase MAX_INTERRUPT_TRIES from 4000 to 12000 to allow worst-case
	  timing: a D60 writing a raw file to CF.

2003-01-27 Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* Major cleanup of comments to make gtk-doc work.
	* Moved "defines for error handling" from canon.h to serial.h.
	* Moved JPEG stream byte #defines from serial.h to canon.h.
	* Slight update of doc string for screen width (library.c).
	* Minor improvements to urb-interpret.
	* Moved MAX_RETRIES from usb.c to usb.h, renamed MAX_INTERRUPT_RETRIES.
	* Rewrite of interrupt-pipe reads based on new insight
	  into communication structure.
	* Now seems to work with EOS D30 as well as PowerShot cameras.
	  Not yet working with EOS D60.
	* Commented prototype for dump_hex in util.h, as it isn't actually
	  defined anywhere.
	* Created doc/canon-api.sgml, doc/canon-sections.txt
	  with tentative structure for documentation.

2003-01-13 Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* Improved some debug logging; added interpretation of power status
	* Re-inserted "get picture abilities" for non-EOS cameras
	* Created special case for PowerShot S45, which (like EOS) doesn't
	  implement the "get picture abilities" command, but (like PowerShot)
	  uses the base "lock keys" command.

2003-01-10  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* canon.[ch]: removed CANON_EXPERIMENTAL_CAPTURE #ifdefs
	* usb.[ch]: removed CANON_EXPERIMENTAL_CAPTURE #ifdefs
	* library.[ch]: removed CANON_EXPERIMENTAL_CAPTURE #ifdefs
	* canon.[ch], serial.c: new serial detection code (with dedicated ID strings)

2003-01-10 Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* Corrected capture sequence, including reads from interrupt pipe.
	  Tested on PowerShot G2 and S45; *not* working for EOS D30/D60
	  cameras.
	* Added function canon_int_get_picture_abilities (currently unused).
	* New command "EOS get body ID" returns camera serial number.
	* Added command and response lengths for "Get available shot" and "Get
	  custom function"
	* Corrected canon_int_get_battery() when return values are NULL
	  pointers.
	* Extended timeout for remote control init, as camera must extend lens.
	* Corrected spelling in various places.
	* urb-interpret: fixed a few bugs. Improved handling of interrupt pipe
	  reads: we now discard those with zero length, but flag and keep others.
2002-11-20  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* canon.[ch]: support for PowerShot G3 (A. Marinichev)

2002-11-03  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* canon.[ch]: support for PowerShot S230

2002-11-02  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* canon.[ch]: support for PowerShot S45

2002-10-25  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* usb.c: added fix for EOS D60 unlocking by Fredrik (reported to work)

2002-10-03  Lutz Müller <lutz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: -I$(top_builddir)/libgphoto2

2002-08-28  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* library.c: s/EXPERIMENTAL_/CANON_EXPERIMENTAL_/
	* canon.[ch], usb.[ch]: s/EXPERIMENTAL_/CANON_EXPERIMENTAL_/
	* library.c: only report EXPERIMENTAL on USB cams
	* Makefile.am: removed EXPERIMENTAL_ CFLAGS stuff
	* README: Added note about new CANON_EXPERIMENTAL_ stuff
	
2002-07-29  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* canon.[ch]: support for PowerShot A100, A200
	
2002-07-29  Lutz Müller <lutz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* canon.h: Make CVS compile again by adding CANON_PS_A100 to the
	  enumeration.

2002-07-24  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* canon.c: started to add duplicate cams
	* library.c: report upload cap only if possible
	* mkpatch: removed, last change from 2000, and not useful for quite
		some time now

2002-05-01  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* canon.c, canon.h, usb.c: added support for EOS D60

2002-04-19  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* canon.c, canon.h: Added support for the IXUS 330,
	  reported working by Oliver Herrmann.

2002-04-08  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* canon.c: better comments, fixed two UTC to localtime
	  typos in debug messages, better debug messages in
	  canon_int_set_time().

	* library.c: fixed reporting of camera time difference in
	  camera_summary() which did not handle DST.

2002-03-29  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* library.c: merged in USB upload patch by Matthias Kramm 
	                 (using #ifdef EXPERIMENTAL_UPLOAD)
                     mark driver as experimental when compiled 
	                 with any of the EXPERIMENTAL_ flags
	* canon.h: merged in USB upload patch by Matthias Kramm
	           properly use EXPERIMENTAL_CAPTURE for int capturing;
	* usb.c: merged in USB upload patch by Matthias Kramm
	* Makefile.am: define EXPERIMENTAL_UPLOAD if requested

2002-03-23  Hans Ulrich Niedermann <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* library.c,Makefile.am: made capture stuff a little easier for testing
	* canon.h: removed last remains from obsolete caching layer
	* library.c,canon.h,usb.c: accelerate non-capture operations by
	  omitting sleep(2) hack when not capturing
	* library.c: added G2 to list of supposedly capture-able cams
	* canon.h: removed last remains from obsolete caching layer

2002-03-22  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* canon.c, canon.h: Added support for the A40, reported
	  by David Willmore.

2002-03-18  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* usb.c, usb.h, library.c, canon.c, canon.h:
	  Committed Emile Snyder's USB remote capture code. This is
	  work in progress, but to ease distribution and avoid
	  conflicts it is included here inside
	  #ifdef EXPERIMENTAL_CAPTURE

	* README: Updated models known to work with the 'new'
	  driver and added a paragraph about the remote capture code
	  included today.

2002-03-08  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* canon.{c,h}, library.c:
	  Implemented EXIF file type support, re-worked thumbnail
	  handling and got rid of the ../../libgphoto2/exif.*
	  dependency.

	* usb.c: Don't keylock S10 - it does that by itself when
	  set to PC mode. Reported by Philipp Kolmann.

2002-01-09  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* *.{c,h}: Re-indented and removed everything
	  #ifdef OBSOLETE to make sources clean before gPhoto2
	  2.0 is released.

2002-01-08  christophe barbé <christophe.barbe.ml@online.fr>

	* usb.c: Change model detection to look at model name instead
	  of USB vendor/product ID since this is required to make the
	  current implementation of overriding camera model work.

2002-01-21  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* usb.c: Don't key lock Pro 90 IS cameras, they do not support
	  it. Reported by Karl Thaller.

	* usb.c, Protocol:
	  Fixed a bug in the init sequence code (write 0x50 bytes like
	  the Windows driver - not 0x10 like we used to). This actually
	  made another bug (in the cameras firmware) surface and we had
	  to mimic the Windows drivers workaround which is to call
	  'Identify camera' multiple times.

	  If you want to read more about this, go read the gphoto-devel
	  archives from around this date. Look for messages about trouble
	  with Canon G1, Pro90IS and EOS D30 cameras.

	* canon.c, canon.h, library.c, serial.c:
	  Reverted behaviour of canon_int_get_time() to return time in
	  cameras time instead of converted to UTC since it makes more
	  sense to display the same time as the camera does on it's
	  display.

	  Made canon_int_get_time() always return gphoto2 status codes.

2002-01-15  Lutz Müller <urc8@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* *.c: gp_camera_status -> gp_context_status

2002-01-14  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* canon.c, library.c: More carefull buffer size checking in some
	  places. We should do a real audit of these.

	* library.c: Fixed mkdir and rmdir functions which did not convert
	  from gphoto paths to canon paths.

2002-01-13  Lutz Müller <urc8@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* *.[c,h]: Replase last call to gp_camera_set_error (I oversaw one
	  hidden in the header file).

2002-01-13  Lutz Müller <urc8@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* *.[c,h]: Replace calls to gp_camera_set_error by gp_context_error.

2002-01-12  Hans Ulrich Niedermann <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* README: New readme for new driver
	
2002-01-11  Hans Ulrich Niedermann <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* *.[ch]: checked in rewritten driver which uses GPFilesystem
		  directly (from the hun branch)
	
2002-01-08  Dan Fandrich <dan@coneharvesters.com>

	* Makefile.am: Removed redundant CFLAGS and LDFLAGS lines

2002-01-07  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* canon.c: Small fix to Dan's portable timezone code from
	yesterday. The wrong time was set.

	* library.c: Improved camera_summary() with better error-checking
	and nicer formatted output.

2002-01-06  Dan Fandrich <dan@coneharvesters.com>

	* util.h: added MIN and MAX definitions
	* library.c: added support for locale-specific thousands separator
	* canon.c: added support for tm.tm_gmtoff to get time zone offset

2002-01-04  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* canon.c, canon.h:
	Changed canon_int_get_time() to convert the time to
	GMT before returning it to the caller to simplify
	time operations elsewhere.

	Changed canon_int_set_time() to accept the time to
	set as a parameter instead of always setting it to
	the computers time. Also use correct endian code
	to convert it to little endian before sending it to
	the camera and hopefully convert the time to local
	timezone before setting it since Canon cameras
	know nothing about timezone.

	* library.c: Reflect changes to get/set_time.

	* canon.c, library.c: Improve error checking and
	debug diagnostics when camera does not return the
	expected ammount of data.

2002-01-01  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* usb.c: Don't keylock G1 cameras, they do not
	  support it. Reported by Jarno Elonen.

2001-12-24  Hans Ulrich Niedermann <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* library.c: stop reporting broken camera abilities

2001-12-23  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* canon.c, canon.h, serial.c, usb.c, util.c, util.h :

	  Patch from Michel Dänzer <daenzer@debian.org>,

	  Handle endian issues when communicating with the
	  cameras by using the new _byteorder.h include
	  provided to us by gphoto2 autoconf.

	* canon.c, canon.h, library.c, serial.c, usb.c :
	  Put all model data in a canonCamModelData structure
	  in canon.h so that there is only one place that has
	  to be changed when adding new models. This is also
	  a start to defining properties/abilities for cameras
	  in a central place instead of checking what model
	  we are talking to everywhere in the code.

	  Output cameras time and the difference between it
	  and the host computers time in --summary.

2001-12-15  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* library.c, canon.h:
	  Moved models[] from library.c to canon.h and added
	  canonCamModel model to models[].

	* usb.c, usb.h:
	  Identify USB cameras based on USB vendor/product ID.
	  This was necessary because we need to know what
	  model it is before initializing since some models
	  do that differently.

	* usb.c:
	  Add special treatment of EOS D30 cameras to
	  canon_usb_camera_init() when camstat is 'A'. Simplified
	  canon_usb_camera_init() in general.

	* usb.c:
	  Moved the code from canon_usb_ready() to
	  canon_usb_init() - canon_usb_ready() should send a
	  'ping' packet to check if the camera is alive instead
	  of doing stuff like identification and key locking.

	* usb.c:
	  Changed canon_usb_dialogue() to read responses in two
	  passes - one that reads as much as possible that is
	  divideable with 0x40 and then one that reads the
	  expected number of bytes modulus 0x40. This is what
	  the windows driver does and it appears some cameras
	  (EOS D30) likes this better.

2001-12-06  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* canon.c, library.c:
	  Re-worked file deleting after reports saying it didn't
	  work. Now it works for me at least.

2001-12-05  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* usb.h:
	  Added EOS D30 (and possibly other models) commands to
	  lock and unlock camera keys.

	* usb.c, usb.h:
	  Renamed canon_usb_keylock() to canon_usb_lock_keys().
	  Added canon_usb_unlock_keys(), the only camera known to
	  support this is the EOS D30. This is called from
	  camera_exit().
	  Corrected comments about how canon_usb_dialogue() works.

	* canon.c: Improved error checking on return from
	  canon_{usb,serial}_dialogue() calls and changed some
	  functions to return GP_ codes instead of hard coded
	  integer values.

	* library.c:
	  Call canon_usb_unlock_keys() from camera_exit() if
	  using USB.

2001-12-04  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>
	
	* canon.c: Improved debug output in canon_int_get_time().

	* canon.c, canon.h, serial.c, serial.h, usb.c, usb.h:
	  Moved canon_int_serial_ready() to serial.c and renamed
	  it to canon_serial_ready().
	  Moved canon_int_usb_ready() to usb.c and renamed
	  it to canon_usb_ready().

	* library.c: Don't say we are switching off camera if
	  USB, since we are not.

	* usb.c: Make canon_usb_keylock() not try to keylock
	  EOS D30 cameras, they seem to do keylocking different.

2001-12-01  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* usb.c, usb.h:
	  Added canon_usb_get_dirents().

	* serial.c, serial.h:
	  Added canon_serial_get_dirents().

	* canon.h: added CANON_MINIMUM_DIRENT_SIZE.

	* canon.c, canon.h:
	  Exchanged canon_int_list_directorys() with my
	  rewritten version. At least some hypothetical bugs
	  fixed, easier to understand and proper error-checking.
	  This should hopefully not break serial, since this is
	  almost the same code as I used when debugging other
	  serial stuff on Philippes computer/camera from 1600
	  km distance a few weeks ago.

	* library.c:
	  Re-wrote _get_file_path() since it was really hard to
	  understand. The first time I tried to understand it I
	  got it all wrong and even added some faulty comments.

	Also replaced some random gp_debug_printf() with
	GP_DEBUG() and re-indented *.c.

2001-11-29  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* usb.c, usb.h:
	  Implemented canon_usb_keylock() which locks the
	  cameras keys and turns off the LCD.

	* usb.c:
	  Changed a read of 0x44 bytes to two, one of 0x40
	  and one of 0x4 bytes. This seems to fix the problems
	  we have had with initialization only working every
	  second time for some cameras.

	  Changed canon_usb_dialogue() to return the number of
	  bytes the caller is interested in rather than the
	  total number of bytes read from the camera for
	  "non-long" reads.

	* canon.c:
	  Move some more code from canon_int_ready() to
	  canon_int_serial_ready().

	  Don't show init errors with gp_camera_status(), use
	  gp_camera_set_error() for that.

	  Updated canon_int_usb_ready() to call new
	  canon_usb_keylock() and also do things in a slightly
	  different order.

2001-11-27  Hans Ulrich Niedermann <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* README: added note about CRW (raw) support
	* canon.c: added support for PowerShot S40
	* canon.h: added support for PowerShot S40
	* library.c: added support for PowerShot S40
	
2001-11-27  Hans Ulrich Niedermann <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* ChangeLog: created new file
	* Changelog: declared deprecated
