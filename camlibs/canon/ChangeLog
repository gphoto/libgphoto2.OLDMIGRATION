	* usb.c, usb.h:
	  Added canon_usb_get_dirents().

	* serial.c, serial.h:
	  Added canon_serial_get_dirents().

	* canon.h: added CANON_MINIMUM_DIRENT_SIZE.

	* canon.c, canon.h:
	  Exchanged canon_int_list_directorys() with my
	  rewritten version. At least some hypothetical bugs
	  fixed, easier to understand and proper error-checking.
	  This should hopefully not break serial, since this is
	  almost the same code as I used when debugging other
	  serial stuff on Philippes computer/camera from 16000
	  km distance a few weeks ago.

	* library.c:
	  Re-wrote _get_file_path() since it was really hard to
	  understand. The first time I tried to understand it I
	  got it all wrong and even added some faulty comments.

	Also replaced some random gp_debug_printf() with
	GP_DEBUG() and re-indented *.c.

	* usb.c, usb.h:
	  Implemented canon_usb_keylock() which locks the
	  cameras keys and turns off the LCD.

	* usb.c:
	  Changed a read of 0x44 bytes to two, one of 0x40
	  and one of 0x4 bytes. This seems to fix the problems
	  we have had with initialization only working every
	  second time for some cameras.

	  Changed canon_usb_dialogue() to return the number of
	  bytes the caller is interested in rather than the
	  total number of bytes read from the camera for
	  "non-long" reads.

	* canon.c:
	  Move some more code from canon_int_ready() to
	  canon_int_serial_ready().

	  Don't show init errors with gp_camera_status(), use
	  gp_camera_set_error() for that.

	  Updated canon_int_usb_ready() to call new
	  canon_usb_keylock() and also do things in a slightly
	  different order.
