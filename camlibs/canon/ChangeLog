	* library.c: stop reporting broken camera abilities

2001-12-23  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* canon.c, canon.h, serial.c, usb.c, util.c, util.h :

	  Patch from Michel Dänzer <daenzer@debian.org>,

	  Handle endian issues when communicating with the
	  cameras by using the new _byteorder.h include
	  provided to us by gphoto2 autoconf.

	* canon.c, canon.h, library.c, serial.c, usb.c :
	  Put all model data in a canonCamModelData structure
	  in canon.h so that there is only one place that has
	  to be changed when adding new models. This is also
	  a start to defining properties/abilities for cameras
	  in a central place instead of checking what model
	  we are talking to everywhere in the code.

	  Output cameras time and the difference between it
	  and the host computers time in --summary.

2001-12-15  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* library.c, canon.h:
	  Moved models[] from library.c to canon.h and added
	  canonCamModel model to models[].

	* usb.c, usb.h:
	  Identify USB cameras based on USB vendor/product ID.
	  This was necessary because we need to know what
	  model it is before initializing since some models
	  do that differently.

	* usb.c:
	  Add special treatment of EOS D30 cameras to
	  canon_usb_camera_init() when camstat is 'A'. Simplified
	  canon_usb_camera_init() in general.

	* usb.c:
	  Moved the code from canon_usb_ready() to
	  canon_usb_init() - canon_usb_ready() should send a
	  'ping' packet to check if the camera is alive instead
	  of doing stuff like identification and key locking.

	* usb.c:
	  Changed canon_usb_dialogue() to read responses in two
	  passes - one that reads as much as possible that is
	  divideable with 0x40 and then one that reads the
	  expected number of bytes modulus 0x40. This is what
	  the windows driver does and it appears some cameras
	  (EOS D30) likes this better.

	* canon.c, library.c:
	  Re-worked file deleting after reports saying it didn't
	  work. Now it works for me at least.

2001-12-05  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* usb.h:
	  Added EOS D30 (and possibly other models) commands to
	  lock and unlock camera keys.

	* usb.c, usb.h:
	  Renamed canon_usb_keylock() to canon_usb_lock_keys().
	  Added canon_usb_unlock_keys(), the only camera known to
	  support this is the EOS D30. This is called from
	  camera_exit().
	  Corrected comments about how canon_usb_dialogue() works.

	* canon.c: Improved error checking on return from
	  canon_{usb,serial}_dialogue() calls and changed some
	  functions to return GP_ codes instead of hard coded
	  integer values.

	* library.c:
	  Call canon_usb_unlock_keys() from camera_exit() if
	  using USB.

2001-12-04  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>
	
	* canon.c: Improved debug output in canon_int_get_time().

	* canon.c, canon.h, serial.c, serial.h, usb.c, usb.h:
	  Moved canon_int_serial_ready() to serial.c and renamed
	  it to canon_serial_ready().
	  Moved canon_int_usb_ready() to usb.c and renamed
	  it to canon_usb_ready().

	* library.c: Don't say we are switching off camera if
	  USB, since we are not.

	* usb.c: Make canon_usb_keylock() not try to keylock
	  EOS D30 cameras, they seem to do keylocking different.

2001-12-01  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* usb.c, usb.h:
	  Added canon_usb_get_dirents().

	* serial.c, serial.h:
	  Added canon_serial_get_dirents().

	* canon.h: added CANON_MINIMUM_DIRENT_SIZE.

	* canon.c, canon.h:
	  Exchanged canon_int_list_directorys() with my
	  rewritten version. At least some hypothetical bugs
	  fixed, easier to understand and proper error-checking.
	  This should hopefully not break serial, since this is
	  almost the same code as I used when debugging other
	  serial stuff on Philippes computer/camera from 1600
	  km distance a few weeks ago.

	* library.c:
	  Re-wrote _get_file_path() since it was really hard to
	  understand. The first time I tried to understand it I
	  got it all wrong and even added some faulty comments.

	Also replaced some random gp_debug_printf() with
	GP_DEBUG() and re-indented *.c.

2001-11-29  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* usb.c, usb.h:
	  Implemented canon_usb_keylock() which locks the
	  cameras keys and turns off the LCD.

	* usb.c:
	  Changed a read of 0x44 bytes to two, one of 0x40
	  and one of 0x4 bytes. This seems to fix the problems
	  we have had with initialization only working every
	  second time for some cameras.

	  Changed canon_usb_dialogue() to return the number of
	  bytes the caller is interested in rather than the
	  total number of bytes read from the camera for
	  "non-long" reads.

	* canon.c:
	  Move some more code from canon_int_ready() to
	  canon_int_serial_ready().

	  Don't show init errors with gp_camera_status(), use
	  gp_camera_set_error() for that.

	  Updated canon_int_usb_ready() to call new
	  canon_usb_keylock() and also do things in a slightly
	  different order.
