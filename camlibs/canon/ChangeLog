	* usb.c, usb.h:
	  Implemented canon_usb_keylock() which locks the
	  cameras keys and turns off the LCD.

	* usb.c:
	  Changed a read of 0x44 bytes to two, one of 0x40
	  and one of 0x4 bytes. This seems to fix the problems
	  we have had with initialization only working every
	  second time for some cameras.

	  Changed canon_usb_dialogue() to return the number of
	  bytes the caller is interested in rather than the
	  total number of bytes read from the camera for
	  "non-long" reads.

	* canon.c:
	  Move some more code from canon_int_ready() to
	  canon_int_serial_ready().

	  Don't show init errors with gp_camera_status(), use
	  gp_camera_set_error() for that.

	  Updated canon_int_usb_ready() to call new
	  canon_usb_keylock() and also do things in a slightly
	  different order.
