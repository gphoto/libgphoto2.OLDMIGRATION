    philm       destination path and filename are now determined at runtime
                when uploading (try to follow the JEIDA DCF standard).
2000-10-07
    philm       fixed some problems with error handling if the camera has
                shut itself off (more work need to be done).
                fixed a problem which would prevent getting correctly the
                path of the pictures from the internal cache.

    philm       fixed minor issues
2000-08-22
    philm       changed serial.c to the latest libusb from CVS (thanks Scott)
                Got serial upload working. it should work at 115200 for S10
                and S20 but only 57600 for everyone else :-(. It is *very*
                slow.
2000-08-21 
    philm       deleted unused functions from canon.c (old configure box
                and related functions).
                changed delete for USB compatibility, works ?
                changed delete to report when a file is protected.
                changed psa50_directory_operations to support USB, works ?
                changed dialog box to use a toggle for set camera time as
                buttons are not yet supported.
2000-08-20
    philm       USB now works thanks to the help of James Tappin and
                Tuomas Jormola.
                make use of gp_setting_set/get to save/get settings
                (only debug for the moment).
2000-08-17
    philm       fixed USB compilation but does it work ?
2000-08-15
    philm       created a working camera_config_set functions
                (saves debug level and owner name).
                modified heavily the driver to use the camlib_data struct
                to store all the variables which were previously global.
                The driver should now be able to use more than one Canon
                camera at a time (not tested). 
2000-08-10
    philm       added a psa50_set_time function to set the camera date
                to the PC date.
                added some widgets to the config dialog box.
                changed camera_summary to report battery status.
2000-08-09
    philm       changed timeout for initialization from 1000 to 900 because
                with 1000 it was working on command line but not GUI.
                started a configure dialog box.
                changed gp_file_list to use gp_list_append.
2000-08-08
    philm       Fixed a bug I introduced for setting the attributes bits.
                Added a fix in canon_serial_send which should speed up some
                operations (like directory download) for others than A50
                because A50 does not like to get too much data in a row.
                Created a TODO file.
2000-08-05
    philm       Driver Adapted to new filename based API. broke A5 support.
2000-07-28
    philm       Added detection for Digital Ixus / PowerShot S100 (untested).
2000-07-25
    philm       First port to gphoto2.
