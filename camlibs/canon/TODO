08/08/2000 - Notes by Philippe Marzouk <philm@users.sourceforge.net>
 - The driver must be changed to be able to talk to various cameras
   via the Camera *camera struct with each function call.
 - USB support is broken as libgpio got changed a bit. I can't test it as
   I don't have USB :-(
 - A5 support is completely broken, with the new filename based API, the 
   directory caching mecanism must be completely revisited.
 - Uploading : I'm working on it but there are problems. I will soon 
   include the preliminary support I got for people with S10 and S20 to test
   as it seems easier to get them working (s10sh does it).
 - The configuration dialog has to be made with the new toolkit independent
   functions provided by gphoto2. It should use gp_config_get and
   gp_config_set to retrieve and store its configuration information.
   I think it should include : date, owner, battery status, firmware 
   revision and Compact flash space used/available.
   I don't know if anything else is needed.
 - Starting a Changelog file.
 - FOLDERS : folders are not supported on the A50 (users have no control on
   the directory where images are stored on the compact flash) so for the
   moment the internal directory structure is hidden to gphoto2.
