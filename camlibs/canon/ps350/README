  renamejpg.c      C program that automatically renames PS350 AUT/THM
                   files (given as arguments) to a `recording-time' format
                   that is much easier to interpret than the original
                   name, like
                     AUT_0365.JPG  =>  aut_19990626-124040.jpg
                   If the destination name already exists, names with
                   appended `-2', `-3' etc. are tried.
