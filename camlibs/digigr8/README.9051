CONCERNING 0x2770:0x9051 CAMERAS:

As of 12/17/2010, the only known camera with this USB ID string is the 
"Lego Bionicle," apparently produced by Digital Blue for Lego. Its 
functionality is very basic. On the package it says the camera is able to take 
40 photos, but in fact the number of photos is variable. For, they are all 
compressed. 

Since the compression algorithm is the same as that in the 0x905C cameras, this  
camera is quite usable, for what it is. Resolution for this camera in still 
mode appears to be nonadjustable and fixed at 640x480. 

The camera has two buttons on it. one on the top and one on the rear. The 
button on top is the shutter button, of course. The button on the rear is 
often called the "mode" button on other cameras, and it will do such things
as to switch the resolution mode, the compression mode, the continuous shooting
mode, and such. But that is on other cameras. Here, that button is a "delete"
button and will perform no other function. To delete the last photo, press that 
button. To delete all, hold it down longer. The photos will be deleted then,
one by one, starting with the last one. The small LCD window on the rear of the
camera will show the decreasing number of photos while the button is being held.

To the best of my ability to determine, the camera has no clip option, 
no delayed-shooting option, and no multi-frame clips intended for AVI images.
As a still camera it will do still photos only, and those will be of dimensions
640x480. 

This camera also supports the option "gphoto2 --capture-preview" which 
means that the camera shoots an image which is immediately downloaded, not
being stored on the camera at all. If gphoto2 --capture-preview is done, then
the resulting frame comes out of the camera at 320x240 resolution. This 
resolution setting is in fact adjustable. Those who are curious may consult

/linux(recent version)/drivers/media/video/gspca/sq905c.c

where resolution-choosing is completely supported. That file supports the
"webcam" functionality of the cameras supported in still mode in 
libgphoto2/camlibs/digigr8. Since I have already made the minor changes
in my kernel source tree which make this camera work as a webcam, I also
mention here that the camera will work as a webcam, too. I only needed to
add the USB Vendor:Product number in the aforementioned kernel source file,
then to run "make modules" and "make modules_install." I was then able to 
make the camera to stream and to choose any of the resolution settings
640x480, 320x240, and 160x120. I promise to add the camera there formally, as
soon as I get around to it, and then after understandable time lag the change
will appear in the kernel source tree, too. 


WARNING: The --capture-preview option *will* delete all photos on the camera.


The option gphoto2 -D is therefore supported, too. However, the user should
note that the USB command to delete is the same as the USB command to shoot a
frame (gphoto2 option is --capture-preview). Again. If you shoot a frame with
the Lego Bionicle, it will delete whatever photos are on the camera !!!
