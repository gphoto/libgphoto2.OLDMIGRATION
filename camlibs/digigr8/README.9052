CONCERNING 0x2770:0x9052 CAMERAS

The only camera reported to use this ID is a Disney Pix Micro camera. It
seems to be a VGA version of the smaller camera with the same name, which 
reports itself as 0x2770:0x9050. The new camera has the resolution settings 
640x480 and 320x240. Both cameras permit deletion of all photos. The same 
operations are used for that as for the capture of an image to the computer
(that is, the gphoto2 --capture-preview operation). The user is therefore 
advised that the --capture-preview operation will also clear the camera's 
memory and remove all images stored there. 

For further details please consult the file README.9050.
