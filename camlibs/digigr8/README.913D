On 08/23/2007, I discovered a new camera with USB ID 0x2770:0x913d. The
basic functions of this camera are the same as those of the 0x2770:0x905c
cameras which are the main ones supported in libgphoto2/camlibs/digigr8, but
there are some small differences. For certain details and for the basic
functionality, the reader should also read README.digigr8, therefore. Only
the basic features and the differences with the previously-supported cameras
are listed here:

Features of the Suprema Digital Keychain Camera:

	-- 640x480 and 320x240 resolution settings
	-- supports gphoto2 --capture-preview option (presumed that the size
		of the output image can be adjusted in code, default
`		320x240; see README.digigr8 for details of that.
	-- apparently does _not_ support multiframe AVI capability, or if so
		it is not mentioned in the written manual. 
	-- a setting does exist for shooting three frames with one shutter
		press, but three only, not more. 
	-- has a viewfinder and preview window on the back, which is very
		nice but presumably eats battery. 
	-- saves photos in volatile SDRAM, so don't let the batteries die. 
	-- permits deletion of individual photos on the camera, by pushing
		some buttons. This feature is not present on the other
		supported cameras and is thus the big difference. Because of
		the way this deletion is done, the function which counts
		photos needed a serious rewrite to accommodate the deletion.
		It will probably not ever be possible, unfortunately, to
		support deletion of any photos or images on the camera, by
		means of software control from the computer.
	-- webcam functionality. The webcam function is obviously
		supportable (gphoto2 --capture-image uses it to shoot one
		frame), but libgphoto2 does not do webcams, so that can't be
		done here. 

On 10/13/07 I discovered that the Sakar Styleshot (Sakar ID no. 28290) is 
also supported, and I have added it to the list of cameras in library.c. Aside 
from appearance, the main difference between the Styleshot and the Suprema 
described above is that the Styleshot has an internal rechargeable battery. 

On 12/23/07 the Sakar Spiderman (no. 92045) has been reported by Martin Laberge 
<mlsoft@videotron.ca>. THERE IS POTENTIAL NAME CONFUSION WITH THIS CAMERA. The
Sakar Amazing Spiderman (no. 94044) has in it a JL2005C chip which is currently
not supported in libgphoto2. Buyer beware!
