Outstanding items in the gphoto2 dimera driver:

- make exposure, auto_exposure, auto_flash user-modifiable config options
- may need to put /temp.ppm into file list

Bugs:

- flash capacity in --summary shows 0 for newer flash cards
- newer cameras (e.g. ver. 6.2eL 1999/24) can't download pictures
(this may have been fixed in dimera3500.c v1.3)
