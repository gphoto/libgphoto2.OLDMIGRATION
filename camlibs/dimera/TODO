Outstanding items in the gphoto2 dimera driver:

- make exposure, auto_exposure, auto_flash user-modifiable config options
- may need to put /temp.ppm into file list
- use gettext to allow internationalized strings

Bugs:

- flash capacity in --summary shows 0 for newer flash cards
- image quality is lower than it could be due to suboptimal Bayer CCD
conversion routine
- some serial port speed settings don't work
