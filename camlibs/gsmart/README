NOTE
----
The cameras always delete the last file on them, no matter what file number is
passed to it for deletion. It is impossible to delete a specific image or
movie on the camera.

TODO
----
The cameras of this series are based on the spca504a and spca500 chip
manufactured by Sunplus. Both chips are capable of streaming, so there's a
project working on video4linux support for them. spca50x.sourceforge.net

Special thanks go to Bjorn Borud <borud@gua.no> who extorted the above
mentioned sources for the windows driver from Mustek and to Buster Lee at
Mustek for being helpful and responsive.

Special thanks also to Tim Sampson <tim@columbia-staver.co.uk>, who made the
support for spca500 based cams (such as the gsmart mini) possible by boldly
trying out my untested alpha versions.

Very special thanks to Piotr Pawlow <pp@siedziba.pl> for adding avi index
functionality and fixing a few bugs.

Also thanks to the following people for testing and feedback:

Torfinn Ingolfsen <torfinn.ingolfsen@broadpark.no>
Mikael Nilsson <mini@nada.kth.se>
Miah Gregory <mace@darksilence.net>
