Mustek gSmart mini 2

This driver is based on the windows driver source kindly provided  by
Mustek. It is known to work with the mini 2 but might very well also work with
other members of the gsmart mini family. I dont have these cameras, so if you
have one and want support for it, you'll have to do it yourself or send
me your camera ;).

If you want to hack on this module, or have questions or suggestions,
don't hesitate to email me:

NOTE
----
The camera always deletes the last file on it, no matter what file number is
passed to it for deletion. It is impossible to delete a specific image or
movie on the camera. 

----------------------------------------------------------------
TODO List
---------
	- implement downloading of avi files
	- implement streaming "webcam" mode

Thanks
