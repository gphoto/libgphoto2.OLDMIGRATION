GSMART 300 DRIVER FOR GPHOTO2
=============================

Note :	this camera is also know as Casio LV-10,
	under the same vendor and product IDs
	(Model actually tested)

This is a very basic camera, which enables to take pictures,
delete last picture or delete all pictures.

Pictures (JPEG format) can be stored in two sizes : 640x480 or 320x240.
In fact, this is not exactly true. The pictures are all 640x480,
but the "samller" ones are just poor quality, so that it becomes
decent only after resizing to 320x240.
Thumnails are downloadable from the camera in YYUV format ONLY
for "big" pictures.

To performs these operations, the Windows drivers uses an
interpolation software which acts as this :

For lower quality, 640x480 pictures are downloaded, and
converted to 320x240. In the same way, 80x60 thumbnails
are generated.

For higher quality, 80x60 thumbnails are downloaded in YYUV
and converted to bitmap. But strangely enough, 640x480
picture are converted into pictures of the same size
by the interpolation software, resulting in a disk-size
about 2 times greater !

The joint driver for gphoto just outputs the higher quality
pictures as they are stored in the camera, as well as bitmap
thumbnails.
Lower quality are left 640x480, and no thumbnail is provided.
