	* serial.[ch], jd11.c: Use new gp_file_progress.
	* jd11.c: Initialize CameraAbilities struct with zeroes.

	* serial.c: Made serial transfers much more robust, with retries
	  and draining of old data.
	  Also use gp_file_progress correctly (hopefully).

	* serial.c: Include <bayer.h>, not "libgphoto2/bayer.h"
