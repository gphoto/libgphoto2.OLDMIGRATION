	* library.c: Added support for "Amazing Spiderman" reported by 
		     Victor Hodge <vhodge@sympatico.ca> and for 
		     Sakar no. 75379 reported by 
		     Patrick Simmons <linuxrocks123@netscape.net> and for
		     Sakar Kidz-Cam no. 88379 reported by 
		     Martin Laberge <mlsoft@videotron.ca>. 
	* *.[c,h]:   Introduced changes to give unified support to both 
		     JL2005C and JL2005B in the same functions. 
		     NOTE: All these cameras use compression, and how to 
		     decompress is still unknown.

	* *.[c,h]: First check-in of experimental driver code. Nothing 
		   much works exactly right. Driver will download data 
		   without freezing the camera, and that's about it.
