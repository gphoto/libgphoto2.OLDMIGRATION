There are still some minor problems/issues:

- Check the epoch problem that occurs when setting/reading the
  camera or file time
- Internationalization
- Allow switching the thumbnail type in preferences
- Clean up the code and add some more comments

To tackle these problems I have to update my linux installation,
so don't expect them too soon.
