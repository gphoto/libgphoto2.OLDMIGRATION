There are still some minor problems/issues:

- Better initialization code for speed. The current code does not
  work very reliable when the camera is on an speed already set
  to 115200
- Implement battery check; the status field in the status table
  is not automatically updated (according to documentation)
- Allow switching the thumbnail type in preferences
- Check the epoch problem that occurs when setting/reading the
  camera or file time
- Internationalization
- Implement a pseudo capturing of previews (by taking a picture
  to the card, downloading and deleting it) for webcam purposes
- Add some more comments
