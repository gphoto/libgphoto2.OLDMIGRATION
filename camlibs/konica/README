History
-------
This library is heavily based upon the work of Phill Hugo who based his work 
heavily "on reverse engineering work by Jesper Skov and his Perl script of 
similar functionality". Additionally, Konica has been very supportive by 
issuing their own driver explaining the syntax of the commands. Konica even 
responded to my questions and gave additional hints. Thank you!

Features
--------
Lots of them :-) This driver supports all features that gphoto provides, plus 
some additional ones. To access those, I have yet to write the configuration 
dialog. Don't hesitate to ask me to write one.
