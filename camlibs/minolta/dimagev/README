This is a fresh driver for the Minolta DImage V camera, which has since been
discontinued. This driver contains no code form my earlier efforts.

The assistance of Minolta was very helpful in writing this driver; I was given
a copy of the specification and told that I could "share it with the Linux
community". I am interpreting this "sharing" as the GNU GPL. Minolta takes no
respondsibility for the information they provided me, which is perfectly fair.
Please see the file COPYING for more information.

This library is far from complete. There are plenty of places where better
sanity checking could be done, such as ensuring that the media is write-enabled
before trying to capture an image. I will continue to work on it until I buy a
newer camera.

Notes on specific functions:
    The capture function takes a picture, downloads it, and then deletes it.
    This image is always named dv00000.jpg, since that holds with the naming
    convention for the rest of the pictures, and simultaneously cannot be a
    valid name for an image retrieved from the camera.
