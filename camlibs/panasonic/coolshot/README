TODO List
---------
- file upload capability
- better error checking ("fixme"s) & recovery
- modify coolshot_file_count to return GP_ code and take *count as argument
	Comment by Lutz <urc8@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>: Why? Throughout libgphoto2,
	we say that negative return values are errors. That is, we do
	CHECK_RESULT (pic_num = count_pictures (camera)); everywhere and let
	CHECK_RESULT test for a return value < 0.
