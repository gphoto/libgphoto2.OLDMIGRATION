2002-03-22  Lutz Müller <lutz@users.sourceforge.net>

	Patch by Andrea Suatoni <a.suatoni@itaca.it>:

	* pdc640.c: IRIX fixes.

2002-03-19  Greg Ingram <ingram@symsys.com>

	* pdc700.c: Added pdc700_set_date() which appears to work.  Is the
	  date widget working completely?  Added the ability to select image
	  size (resolution).  The configuration dialog was getting rather too
	  tall so I split it up onto three sections (tabs).
	
	* pdc700.c: Fix off-by-one thinko in get_config where the 
	  camera's month datum is one-based but tm.tm_mon is
	  zero-based.

2002-01-15  Lutz Müller <lutz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pdc700.c: Introduced a bug in last fix...

2002-01-15  Lutz Müller <urc8@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* pdc700.c: When status is PDC_STATUS_FAIL, the camera will only 
	  send the checksum, nothing else.

2002-01-13  Lutz Müller <urc8@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* pdc700.c: Remove references to gp_camera_set_error.

2002-01-09  Dan Fandrich <dan@coneharvesters.com>

	* jd350e.c: Added definitions of MIN and MAX

2001-11-28  Lutz Müller <urc8@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* pdc700.c: Rename PDC700_FIRST into PDC700_FAIL. Try to implement
	  some error recovery strategy.
