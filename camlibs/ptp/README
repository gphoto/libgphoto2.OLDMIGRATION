This is libptp2!

This library is under developement yet.
It's designet to use with gphoto2, but can be easily used with any other
software.

There is a sample test_ptp.c code which shows how to use libptp2 without
gphoto2. You can use test_ptp.c as a quick startup for your own ptp
application. Vide library.c to see how to use libptp2.
Sorry, no docs yet :(

To compile test_ptp.c type:
cc -g -O2 -g -Wall -I/usr/local/include/libexif -I../../libgphoto2 -I/usr/local/include -g -Wall test_ptp.c -lusb ptp.o -o test_ptp

or something similar :)

Enjoy!

Documentation

While ptp transactions usage seems to be quite obvious the ptp events
handling code should be documented.
