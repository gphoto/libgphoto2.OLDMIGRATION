This is libptp2!

This library is under developement yet.
It's designet to use with gphoto2, but can be easily used with any other
software.

To compile test_ptp.c type:
cc -g -O2 -g -Wall -I/usr/local/include/libexif -I../../libgphoto2 -I/usr/local/include -g -Wall test_ptp.c -lusb ptp.o -o test_ptp

Enjoy!
