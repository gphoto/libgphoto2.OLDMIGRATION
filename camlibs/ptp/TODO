Unordered TODO list:

-- folders implementation.

-- implementation of GetStorageInfo and GetStorageID's and proper
interpretation of it's fields, which may be meaningful for driver behavior.

-- packing and unpacking functions which interprete whole structures of
specyfied type (especialy proper extraction of variable length fields).

-- remove ptp error code from library.c, separate ptp protocol code from
gphoto2 driver.
