Unordered TODO list:

-- packing and unpacking functions which interprete whole structures of
specified type (especialy proper extraction of variable length fields).
For example _PTPObjectInfo which containes all data in packed format (may be
defined as char[] table!) and PTPObjectInfo type (NOT packed), which is used
by C interface.
All ptp_getobject/sendobject would use PTPObjectInfo, then convert internaly
to proper dataset of _PTPObjectInfo (respecting host to transport layer byte
order conversion) and then writing/reading to/from responder.
The same for other data structures.

-- folders implementation.

-- implementation of GetStorageInfo and GetStorageID's and proper
interpretation of it's fields, which may be meaningful for driver behavior.

-- remove ptp error code from library.c, separate ptp protocol code from
gphoto2 driver.
