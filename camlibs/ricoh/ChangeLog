	* ricoh.c: Simplify code by introducing ricoh_transmit. As a side 
	  effect, this should improve error recovery, too.

2002-06-18  Martin Fischer <martin.fischer@inka.de>

	Patch adapted by Lutz Müller <lutz@users.sourceforge.net>.

	* ricoh.[c,h]
	* library.c: The driver supports GP_FILE_OPERATION_PREVIEW. 
	  Support for Philips ESP80 was added. camera_about was added.

	* ricoh.[c,h]
	* library.c: This driver supports GP_FILE_OPERATION_DELETE and
	  GP_OPERATION_CAPTURE_IMAGE. Support for
	  configuration is still missing. Awaiting patches...

	* ricoh.[c,h]
	* library.c: Remove CameraPrivateLibrary. Sure, that introduces 
	  some communication overhead, but the code is cleaner this way.

	Submitted by <cliff@vixen.snipe444.org>. I fixed indentation.

	* ricoh.[c,h]
	* library.c: Make the driver functional.

	* ricoh.[c,h]: More functions ported.
