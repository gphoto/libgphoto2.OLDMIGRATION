        * Intermediate checkin of my current work.

          - Can read bitstream to some degree and extract the DCT tables.

        * Imported SiPix StyleCam Blink driver from 
          Vincent Sanders <vince@kyllikki.org>

        * Cleaned it up and made it work, still dumps compressed images.
