Logitech pocket digital - previously someone had marked this as a 
compatible camera, whereas it wasn't really (different USB id and
everything!)

Anyway - the logitech has a fairly different protocol, so I've added
support for that, with the caveat that logitech's imaginary 1024x768
images are downloaded as 640x480 (the size they're stored on the 
camera).  If you want to double the size, use the gimp!
