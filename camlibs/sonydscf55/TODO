* The original 0.4 driver contained code for downloading MPEG files.
Unfortunately, that code did not work correctly when using an Sony
MSAC-SR1 in combination with memory sticks from a Sony DCR-PC100. In this
case, when the device is queried for a list of MPEG files it lists the
JPEG still images. For now, the MPEG code has been left out.

* Fix all FIXME's

* Add calls to gp_frontend_status()

* In cases where an error occurs during transfer, the driver can get
out of sync with the device. From that point on, the driver is unable
to successfully initialise the driver, even for new gPhoto sessions. A
reboot (power-off, power-on) of the MSAC-SR1 device helps. See if it
is possible to do a proper init in such a case.
