This directory contains drivers for camerase that use the
Sound Vision Inc (http://www.soundvisioninc.com)
"Clarity 2" Chipset.

The Agfa ePhoto CL18 type cameras are an earlier design known
as the "1307" which support 640x480 and USB only.

The Tiger FastFlicks type design is the "V1 Low-Cost Dual Mode VGA 
Digital Camera" which can do many resolutions, short MOV movies,
and complact-flash of a sort.

Sound Vision licences the design to many companys, hence
the wide variety of brands supported by this driver.

Sound Vision refuses to release documentation, so this driver is based
entirely on reverse-engineering USB transactions.
