This camlib supports the following cameras:

Aiptek Pencam
Medion MD 5319 (Aldi-Cam)

There are probably others with this chip and flash storage which we dont know
about. They should also work.

It owes everything to the work of Mark Zimmermann <mark@foresthaven.com> whose
pencamread tool I have simply ported to a gphoto2 camlib. The macam driver by
Matthias Krauﬂ was also helpfull. All features are theirs, all bugs are mine.

I dont own a camera of this type, so I had to rely on Armin Janssen
<unclebenz@foni.net> to tirelessly produce usb snoops, test and give feedback.
Without Armin this would not have been possible, so if you own a camera that
is supported by this driver consider sending him an email and thanking him for
risking his cam so yours works on linux ;).
