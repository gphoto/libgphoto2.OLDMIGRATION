Here is a short list of things which might still need work. It is envisioned
that this list might change from time to time. 

1. The compression mode still is not completely unscrambled. 

2. The function sq_postprocess ( ) could still be improved. People are
encouraged to test it, to tweak it, to turn it off if totally unsatisfied...

3. The function sq_postprocess ( ) is not at present usable in the
processing of capture data. The reason for this is that the function as
presently constituted uses configuration data provided by the camera for
still photos, and the camera provides no such corresponding data when
operating in videocam mode. This ought somehow to be addressed. See item 4.

4. The behavior of cameras in capture mode varies wildly according to model
(perhaps related to the so-called chip ID). For example, I own two cameras
which, when gphoto2 --capture-preview is used under artificial light,
produce photos of dramatically different brightness. One of them produces
fairly normal results, and the photos from the other are nearly black. The
second camera will work better under such conditions if for example the
gamma setting is tweaked, but then the first one produces an almost-white
image. 

5. I cannot get thumbnails to work if I am using digikam. Could be just my
computer, because digikam seems to work for some other people.
