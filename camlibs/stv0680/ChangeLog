	* library.[ch], stv680.c: Store image data directly in CameraFile,
	  instead of passing it around unnecessary. (we should add progress
	  for serial too).

2001-01-23  Kurt Garloff <garloff@suse.de>
	
	* library.c, bayer.c: Enhanced the light
	  processing even more.

	* sharpen.c: Fixed off by one error.

	* demosaic_sharpen.c:
	  Add demosaicing which uses adaptive weighted interpolation
	  rather than the simplistic bilinear one.
	  Results in sharper and less noisy pictures.
	  Further reduce traditional sharpening.

	* sharpen.c: Added include of string.h to get memcpy prototype

	* bayer.c, saturate.c, library.c:

	  From Kurt Garloff:

	  * The sharpening seems to be overdone a bit -- for darker images,
	    the noise gets amplified too much and the picutre gets too
	    snowy/grainy.
	  * The colour correction sometimes also seems to go too far and
	    a compormise between the original and the processed image would
	    seem best.

	* bayer.c, library.c: Integrated a speedup of the
	  preview debayer/scaler routine from Kurt Garloff.

2001-12-29  Marcus Meissner <marcus@jet.franken.de>
	
	* saturate.[ch]: Merged from pencam-0.50, which got it from GIMP. 
	  Adapted to not use global variables.
	* library.c: Use saturation filter.
	 
	  (Done by Kevin, merged by me)

2001-12-21  Lutz Müller <urc8@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* stv0680.c (camera_capture): Tell the filesystem about the new
	  file.

2001-12-05  Lutz Müller <urc8@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* library.c: Fix includes
