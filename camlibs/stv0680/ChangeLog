	* bayer.c, saturate.c, library.c:

	  From Kurt Garloff:

	  * The sharpening seems to be overdone a bit -- for darker images,
	    the noise gets amplified too much and the picutre gets too
	    snowy/grainy.
	  * The colour correction sometimes also seems to go too far and
	    a compormise between the original and the processed image would
	    seem best.

	* bayer.c, library.c: Integrated a speedup of the
	  preview debayer/scaler routine from Kurt Garloff.

	* saturate.[ch]: Merged from pencam-0.50, which got it from GIMP. 
	  Adapted to not use global variables.
	* library.c: Use saturation filter.
