This is the Toshiba PDR-M65 Camera Library.

The communication protocol is documented in the Protocol.txt file located
in this directory.

Any questions or comments about this driver should be addressed to the
author, me, Sean Bruno <sean.bruno@dsl-only.net>

This driver should be able to function with the PDR-M60 and PDR-M61 with
minor modifications, namely the USB vendor/product ID.
