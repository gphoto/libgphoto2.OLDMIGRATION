Q: I get the error message

      Could not find USB device (vendor 0x0000, product 0x0000). Make
      sure this device is connected to the computer

   What can I do to make it work?

A: You have to set up the permissions on your USB device correctly.
   For Linux, this is described in the file named gphoto2.txt in
   your gphoto2 documentation directory (named doc/ in the source tree).

========================================================================

Q: gphoto2 does not work, the driver reports some error messages.
   What shall I do?

A: First of all make sure, that you have only one instance of gphoto2
   installed on your system. Unless you know what you're doing you should
   remove all gphoto2 installation, then you may do (as root):
   rm -rf /usr/local/lib/gphoto2*
   rm -rf /usr/lib/gphoto2*
   (above applyes specialy if you used package and CVS version)
   After that install newest gphoto2 and test whether it works now.
   If not, see below.

Q: I have a special problem with CameraXYZ. Where can I find information
   about it?

   located in camlibs/<driver>/ in your source tree.

   How can I make USB work?

   solution, please let us know.
