* CameraFile's must be created using gp_file_new()
* gp_file_clean/free do 2 different things

* if gp_init() is not called, no cameras will be available
  (found by experience. whoops! :)


Quick guide for frontend-writers:
     - gp_camera_new
     - strcpy camera->model (get it for example through gp_camera_name)
     - strcpy on camera->port
     - gp_camera_init
  Main loop:
     - gp_camera_whatever_operation
  On cleanup:
     - gp_camera_unref
