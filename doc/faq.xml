    <question>
      <simpara>What can I do about the error message "Could not find USB device"?</simpara>
    </question>
    <answer>
      <para>
	The exact error message looks like
      </para>
      <screen>
Could not find USB device (vendor 0x0000, product 0x0000). Make
sure this device is connected to the computer
      </screen>
      <para>
	You have to set up the permissions on your USB device correctly.
	This is described in The gPhoto2 Manual, which is available at

	<ulink url="http://n-dimensional.de/projects/digicam/The_gPhoto2_Manual/">http://n-dimensional.de/projects/digicam/The_gPhoto2_Manual/</ulink>.

	See especially the section "Setting up permissions for USB ports".

    <question>
      <simpara>gphoto2 does not find my camera. What shall I do?</simpara>
    </question>
    <answer>
      <para>      
	First try to run "gphoto2 --list-ports" and look whether the ports 
	you want to use are listed there:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <simpara>	
	    For serial devices, the port with the appropriate device must be
	    listed
	  </simpara>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <simpara>
	    For USB devices, you need the "usb:" port in the list. If you
	    don't see it, check whether you compiled gphoto2 with libusb
	    support.
	  </simpara>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
	Then try to run "gphoto2 --auto-detect" and look whether the camera
	is detected.
      </para>
      <para>
	If your gphoto2 cannot access the USB device as non-root users, you
	have to set up hotplugging correctly. See FIXME for details.
      </para>
      <para>
	AND DO NOT RUN gphoto2 AS ROOT. And no other libgphoto2 frontend either.

    <question>
      <simpara>Why do I get the error message "Could not claim the USB device"?</simpara>
    </question>
    <answer>
      <para>
	The exact message looks like
      </para>
      <screen>
*** Error ('Could not claim the USB device') ***

Could not claim interface 0 (Operation not permitted). Make sure no
other program or kernel module (e.g. dc2xx or stv680) is using the 
device and you have read/write access to the device. 
      </screen>
      <para>
	You have to make sure that no such kernel module is loaded and that
	you have set up the permissions on your USB device correctly,
	such that you have (non-root) write access to the camera device.
	How to set this up, is described at FIXME.

      <simpara>Dudes, Windows is the way to go. How do I compile
	gphoto2 for that environment?</simpara>
    </question>
    <answer>
      <para>
	We don't have the money to buy Windows and something like Visual C.
	Therefore, we can't provide you a gphoto2 for Windows. You have two 
	choices (at least):
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <simpara>
	    Buy a fast computer, buy Windows and Visual C and some manuals on
	    how to access USB or serial ports on Windows. Send all that
	    including a blank cheque to us (ask for the address on
	    gphoto-devel@gphoto.org).
	  </simpara>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <simpara>
	    Try to figure out how to get gphoto2 working on Windows

    <question>
      <simpara>I wanna have CVS write access. How do I get one?</simpara>
    </question>
    <answer>
      <simpara>
	We provide CVS write access to persons that show 
	<emphasis>continued</emphasis> interest in a 
	<emphasis>specific part</emphasis>
	of gphoto2. 
	If there is already a person maintaining this 
	specific part of gphoto2 (i.e. a camera driver), we prefer you
	submit patches to the maintainer who will then check them in
	or request modifications.

    </question>

    <answer>
      <para>     
	If your name is not listed in gphoto2/MAINTAINERS, and if we
	haven't heard from you lately, we assume that you finished
	your work on gphoto2 and that you don't need write access any
	longer. If this is not the case, please contact one of the
	project admins.
