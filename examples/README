Sample snippets for programmatic camera usage.

This directory contains sample snippets for your C/C++ program accessing
cameras for various purposes.

Files with helper routines:
	autodetect.c: Auto detecting multiple cameras and initializing
	              specific cameras.

	config.c: Querying and setting configuration values.

	context.c: Handling of GPContext for error reporting and so on.

	samples.h: Header file for above helper files.

Files with samples:
	sample-autodetect.c: Simple camera autodetection and simple API
			     calls.

	sample-multi-detect.c: Same as above, but autodetect and use all
	                       cameras.

	sample-owner.c:	Gets or Sets the Camera Owner. Demonstrates string
			variable configuration handling.

	sample-capture.c: Minimalistic remote capture sample.

	sample-trigger-capture.c: New capture trigger and then loop example.

	lunkwill-canon-capture.c: A simple capture program that captures
	                          a single image, retrieves it to disk,
				  and removes it from the camera.
				  (Despite the Canon comments this likely
				   works on all capture cameras.)

	preview.c: A sample preview loop, it will get 100 previews in
			1 row as fast as possible. 


If you find a common thing to do missing, please report them (or do them
yourselves and send patches).

Please do not keep good sample code for yourself.
