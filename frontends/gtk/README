  Hey look, I'm putting stuff into the README file, so you'd better be
reading this :-)

  The topics contained w/in are completely up for debate if anyone so 
chooses, but overall i think that they work out ok.

  Ok - quick synopsis(sp) of some things : 
  
  1) i'd rather see lots of src files that need to be compiled then 
     just 3 or 4 - i think it makes clarity and searching for things
     a helluva lot easier. so, having said that....

  2) i'm trying to stick w/ some function naming conventions. i know that
     i hate plodding through source trying to find stuff, only to find
     that it's in the last place i would look, so having said that....

	any function ending in _cb is a callback, and belongs in 
	callbacks.c (ie config_camera_cb)

	no functions should be in callback.c that are not callbacks.

  3) i'm trying to keep helper functions in an appropriate file. if there
     isn't one, i've created it - and i'm sure that there will end up
     being a misc.c at some point b/c i couldn't find a good place for them.

     i'd say that any function that requires the use of more then one
     helper function should reside in it's own file. unless of course, 
     the helper functions are completely unrelated, and then they should
     probably just end up in misc.c 

	ie - camera_utils.c contains all helper functions that will deal
	with creating and manipulating camera settings, etc through 
	the gtk interface.

	tree_list_utils (and i don't think i like this name, but for now) -
        deals w/ functions that are used to manipulate and create 
	trees. 

  4) well - i don't have a 4 at this time, but i could later, so 
     make sure you keep checking back.
