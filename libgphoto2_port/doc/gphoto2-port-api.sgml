    <para>
      GPhoto2-Port is the GPhoto2 I/O library.

      The benefit to using this library would be that all communications can be
      done quickly and without worry for device specific functions; all devices
      are abstracted to a point, allowing you to read/write to a device using
      the same interface. For example, you can set all the options on the
      serial port easily, and then read/write to that device. Additionally,
      you could easily switch over to a USB device, and read/write without
      having to learn the USB internals.

      The whole idea behind this is simplicity. It should be easy to write a
      program that uses any sort of serial-based device. This will take the
      hassle out of playing with low-level configurations and actually just
      get on to writing the core of the application.
